SWIFT (Self-Play Weighted Fine-Tuning) extends self-play alignment with teacher-guided token-level importance weighting.
</p>

## Overview

SWIFT builds on SPIN and improves token-level learning signals during self-play fine-tuning.  
Instead of treating every token equally, SWIFT uses token importance estimated from a stronger teacher model, enabling better alignment and stronger distillation behavior.

## Core Idea (from the paper)

- Token-level weighting: focus optimization on more informative tokens.
- Teacher-guided guidance: use a stronger model for token importance instead of direct logits matching.
- Practical tokenizer mapping: transfer token weights across teacher/student tokenizers.

## Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate SWIFT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

Download:
- SFT data: [Link SFT data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCLA-AGI/SPIN_iter1)
- Preference data: [Link DPO data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized)

## Training Pipeline

### 1) Download Base Checkpoint

```bash
python scripts/download.py
```

### 2) Run Self-Play Training

```bash
bash scripts/_SPIN_full.sh
bash scripts/_SWIFT_full.sh
```

(`_SWIFT_full.sh` is the Self-Play Weighted Fine-Tuning pipeline used for SWIFT in this repo.)
